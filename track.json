Donations are simply once off and forgettable. This talk will explore how we can create a meaningful social impact economy using ethereum and some radical economics. In 2018, Wyl and Posner released a book called radical markets, that discussed interesting ideas such as having assets that are Always For Sale (AFS). This can be applied in a very interesting manner to a non-fungible token market, where the proceeds of generated from this AFS mechanic can create a meaningful social impact economy. As a POC, https://wildcards.world was developed which is currently generating hundreds of dollars a month to protect endangered animals."

If he doesn't, he will have to resort to authorities that will provide a certified translator (albeit expensive).\nBut again, the customer will still have to trust certifying authorities (a government or a company) and assume the certified translator will do an excellent job to protect their reputation.\nIs there a better and trustless way to handle translations?"

These types of systems are arguably the most decentralized, as they don’t rely on any other crypto or fiat currency in order to maintain their stability. However they can be complex to build and analyze, and may be particularly vulnerable to a decline in market confidence around the seigniorage token or the cryptocurrency space as a whole."

      "Track": "dApps / UX /UI",
      "Category": "Talk",
      "Abstract": "Omen is a new decentralized prediction market offering operated by the dxDAO based on Gnosis's Conditional Tokens Framework. Currently, most prediction markets like Augur are using an order book model, which requires liquidity providers (market makers) to implement trading strategies. This requirement and the gas costly operation of an order book are major blockers to the adoption of prediction markets. Omen is solving the liquidity problem by using crowd-sourced automated market makers to provide liquidity using a simple predefined trading strategy. Based on the Uniswap model, liquidity is provided and incentivized by adding a spread to the outcomes, which is given to liquidity providers. Markets are resolved by utilizing the realit.io escalation process with the dxDAO as possible final arbitrator.\nThis combination of building blocks allows users to setup a prediction market on Omen within 60 seconds incentivizing participation from the start.\nThe presentation will cover all parts of Omen in detail and explain how you can start your first prediction market."

After briefly touching base on the advantages of smart contract accounts over externally owned accounts (EOAs), we will share insights and what we found to be useful metrics, including the number of deployed instances, the number of funds stored, activity, transfer volumes, and user retention. The presentation will close with a summary of learnings, challenges, and how we intend to overcome these with the Gnosis Safe."

By buying or selling yTokens, users can synthetically lend or borrow the target asset for a fixed term. yTokens are fungible and trade at a floating price, which means their “interest rates” are determined by the market. The prices of yTokens of varying maturities can be used to infer interest rates, and even to construct a yield curve. yTokens can be built using an on-chain price oracle, or, when the target asset is an on-chain asset, using “physical settlement”."

Full decentralization is achieved by making the settlement process permissionless and allowing anyone to submit a “better” solution within a given time.\nIn this presentation we focus on how to quantify “better” prices. We examine some classic auction design approaches such as maximizing trader’s welfare/utility and demonstrate their limitations when applied to the EVM.\nFrom there we will derive the metric used in dƒusion to find the “fairest” settlement.\nFinally, we motivate why this mechanism is superior in highly fragmented markets (e.g. USD stablecoins)."

Unfortunately trading the associated assets usually happens on centralized exchange which becomes a trusted third party. This defeats the purpose of a trust-less system. Atomic cross-chain swaps solve this problem for exchanges of value without intermediaries. But they require both blockchains to support Hash locked and Time locked transactions. We propose an extension to atomic swap for blockchains that only support multi-signatures (multisig) transactions. This provides greater capabilities for cross-chain communications without adding any extra trust hypothesis. "

When VRFs are combined with a proper reputation system, the eligibility of each peer can be defined by its previous actions; the better it behaves, the more likely it will be to become eligible (and thus, rewarded). We discuss the properties that such a system can achieve and the reasons why it can be ideal for Decentralized Oracle Networks."

Since sidechains are faster and cheaper than the ETH mainnet, sidechains can impement novel features and technologies to augment existing ETH/EVM functionalities.   I am going to review five sidechain innovations that SKALE sidechains implement: storage, dynamic pricing, asynchronous Proof-of-Stake consensus, interchain messaging/money transfer and tokenless transactions.  For each feature I will provide a code sample to use it in real world DApps."

Collateralized intermediaries combined with state verification (SPV) or validation (NIZKP and fraud proofs) allow to prevent financial damage to users.

      "Abstract": "The talk focuses on the future evolution of public blockchains. Currently most blockchains are launched and then their design/economics/... are set in stone. However it is highly unlikely that the early versions of blockchains already have hit product/market fit. Newer blockchains such as Tezos, Polkadot and to some extent Cosmos have build-in mechanism to decide upon and implement upgrades. However a large remaining question is whether governance systems are willing to move fast enough and if they are willing to pay for the development to happen. This talk will explore everything around incremental evolution of public blockchains in order to get to the point where they solve real world issues."

      "Abstract": "La blockchain et les actifs numériques ne sont plus des sujets entièrement vierges, mais ils ont encore leur part de mystère. L’évolution rapide des technologies et des usages rend une vision d’ensemble difficile. Nous avons souhaité, dans le cadre de cette conférence réunissant les cas d’usages les plus innovants de l’écosystème, apporter un éclairage global sur cette industrie et son avenir, à destination du public francophone.\n Dans cette série d’interventions exclusivement en français, nous explorerons les futurs développements de l’industrie des crypto-actifs au travers de ses trois thèmes les plus porteurs aujourd’hui : la finance décentralisée, les objets numériques individualisés (non-fongibles) et les organisations collectives sur blockchain (DAOs). \n Au travers, d’une part, une exploration synthétique de ces cas d’usage et, d’autre part, d’une introduction et mise en perspective, nous explorerons l’avenir de cette industrie naissante et notamment de sa place et de son rôle en France et en Europe.\n Cette série d’interventions s’adresse à un large public (utilisateur, investisseur, politique, développeur ou simple curieux) et elle pourra utilement servir d'introduction aux nombreuses interventions de la conférence EthCC."
